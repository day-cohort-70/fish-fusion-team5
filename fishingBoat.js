ENGLISH:

Data structure will be an array of objects named fish array
Here are the properties of each fish.
    -Species
    -Weight
    -Price (prices range from $3.00 to $10.00 per fish)
    -Amount (how many of this species were caught today)

Define a function that the other modules can invoke in order to see today's catch.
The function will be called boatInventory. 
When the function is invoked it will return the array of fish objects 

CODEENGLISH:

const boatInventory = (item in the array)=> {
-Species
    -Weight
    -Price 
    -Amount
return  daily catch
}


( go back and compair notes for the bug rangler)

-we will need to use reqire and export to connect this function to the other modules

Update!









*/


export {boatInventory};
